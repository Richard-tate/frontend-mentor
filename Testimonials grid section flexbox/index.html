                      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
                      current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
                      got every penny's worth.

                      looking to make a transition and have heard some pepole who had an
                      amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course an
                      found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                      weeks was the best-and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                      completing the course, I've sucessfuly switched careers, working as a

                      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
                      Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
                      easy.

                      The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
                      really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
                      able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
                      developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
                      attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
                      people.

                      " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                      needed some structured from professionals who can helpme learn
                      programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                      The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                      hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                      next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, Iâ€™ve
                      often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                      developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
